# Feedback     
The feedback of the pitch. The app wouldn't be off use to much people who don't care to comtrol their
study times. The app can use a break increment system to help to students have proper breaks so they don't overwork themselves.
 The app needs to improve the mathematical system and to be properly structured. The interface should be user friendly. The
 app should also add in a schedule system that the values and the subjects.
