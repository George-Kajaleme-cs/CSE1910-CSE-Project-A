# Log Message for Major Project for Week 1
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for the first week to complete, the frame work of the project, by creating all the mathematical scenario's that were needed to allow all the calculations for the application to be made, and stored.

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Me and my group member didn't accomplish our goal for the first week. We managed to create all the necessary variables and begin programming the interface. The use of certain functions within processing didn't work and made it difficult to implement them into the project. Other reasons was because of lack of communication reduced the amount of time we had in contact and didn't let us coordinate the project together. The project wasn't finished from lack of resources in Georges case as he created the functions and understood them but couldn't implement them into the T work of the coding and use them later.
## What did you learn this week?
We learned that implementing and easier method of communication can be very fruitful for our project. George learned how to create certain variables and plans to implement them into his project quickly after he learns how to create them properly and implent.

## What is your goal for next week?
Our groups goal for the next week is to complete all the functions and the addition of the interface creation and run preliminary tests. Next week we will create the functions within the existing scenario's that will display the options of the studyer and create screen of the values, regarding the scenario determined by the studyer's values. The project should also run very well and be able to produce results for the project mathematically and project lists and objectives very well.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
The problems faced next week will be creating the displays interface and making the program running without bugs. The other problem our group displays is the use of buttons effficently, and making sure that they have nothing wrong with them. The last issue we may face is meeting this weeks quota and being setup for the completion and creation of a useful interface.
