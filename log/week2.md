* Create a function that holds all the scenarios for the if statements that update the values for the compensators
* Finish all the functions that have to do with math this week 

Leandro

* to make the buttons work for the specific pages
* to make a page for mainMenu
* to make a page for pommodoro
* to make a page for study divisor timer
* to make a pommodoro timer

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?

George 
Yes, I accomplished these things this  weeks work 
* I created a function that held all of the if statements that contained all the possible scenario's in the prgram
* I created all the if statements to update the values in each if statement scenario.
* I finished making all statements or scenario's that will be used in the assignment  determining the function run
I didnt't accomplish
* I didn't create the functions for the interface, of the project determining what will be shown and what won't be shown
This happened because I didn't know what to make the interface look like and how many images can show up on the screen


## What did you learn this week?
George

* I learned how to use a different value to replace that was being read as string
* I learned how to update the values for each if statement by changing the values in the setup ,because they can affect the values in draw.a
* I also learned where to place updating systems, because prior to using setup I placed all values in draw and it didn't work at all.



## What is your goal for next week?
Goal for next week is start and finish all the interface related areas of work. Finish the creation of the fuctions for the displaying of all scenarios.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
The main challenges facing our group next week is limiting the amount of options available for the screen to handle,
and merging all our prior work together for the different parts of the assignment we were working on. So, the project runs smoothly and without and problems that are very blatant and then around the end debugging all our work.
