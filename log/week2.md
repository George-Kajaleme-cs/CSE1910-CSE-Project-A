## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?

George 
Yes, I accomplished these things this  weeks work 
* I created a function that held all of the if statements that contained all the possible scenario's in the prgram
* I created all the if statements to update the values in each if statement scenario.
* I finished making all statements or scenario's that will be used in the assignment  determining the function run
I didnt't accomplish
* I didn't create the functions for the interface, of the project determining what will be shown and what won't be shown
This happened because I didn't know what to make the interface look like and how many images can show up on the screen

Leandro
* I have accomplished making a class for buttons
* I made the buttons work for each page that the button is on
* I made a mainMenu page containing Study Timer,PomodoroTimer, and an unavailable button for a game if we finished
* I made a page for the pommodoro timer
* made the pommodoro timer work
* made a page for study timer but did not make it work.YET
