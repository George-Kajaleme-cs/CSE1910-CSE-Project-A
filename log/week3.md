# Log Message for Major Project for Week 3
## What was your goal for the past week?

George
* The creation of displayments for all the scenario if statements for the study time divisor
* The proper calculations displaying for the proper scenario
* Correcting the height I found was prominent in all my scenarios

Leandro
* fix timer bugs
* make a game for the app
* fix any problems with the icons when its on the app


## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
George
Accomplish
* Managed to complete the displaying of scenario values
* Created the proper displaying items for each option
* Fixed the difference in spacing between values or texts
* Lastly I prepped the slides display system to be added into the pages for merging the interfaces
Not Acccomplish
* Didn't manage to merge the interface of my partner and the math code in the background with my display, which is supposed to be finished this week, so we can debug for the remaining weeks.

Leandro
Accompish
* I fixed the timer bug by removing the ponnodoro timer start page
* found out a theme for a game , pong
* I started making the game for the app

Not Accomplished
* need to fix the AI of the paddle
* the ball has bugs
* georges match code not yet intergrated

## What did you learn this week?
George
* I learned how to make different value sets have the same starting height for the x values by adding y= whatever value and starting from that height for each mathematical value.
* I learned that the difference between displaying/ running a program can be completely changed with the flip of a less than or greater sign
* I learned how to efficiently test my code, for what I need it to put out and the scenario's it should print
* I learned how to properly format my displaying of values so that everything can be seen an accessed by everyone
* I also learned how to properly use brackets so that my code has the proper structure and isn't read wrong or have any bugs preventing it from running

Leandro
* I learn how to make an AI for the game pong
* by combining the AI code on both sides you can battle computer vs. computer
* how to tidy up my code so it is easier to read
* istead of making my own buttons I imported a libraty for easy use
## What is your goal for next week?
George
* Merging the interface Leandro made with my own displaying device
* Hopefully finding an easier interface method that is more user friendly
* Also outlining what the projedct does in a slide in the app/ program 

Leandro
* to fix the bugs for the AI of the computer paddles
* intergrate george's code intro my code
* make the ball randomly picks a side where it bounces
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
George
* Figuring out if its possible to create a more user friendly interface
* Make sure all prior coding has no bugs, so for the last week we can spend it debugging the whole project and testing the game

Leandro
* the AI for the paddle
* Intergrating George's code with my code
* demo page for the pong game two AI's battling each other
